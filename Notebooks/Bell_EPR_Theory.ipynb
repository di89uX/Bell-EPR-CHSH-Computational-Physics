    "## Connection to EPR Assumptions and Bell’s Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell’s theorem can be understood as a precise analysis of the assumptions implicit in the EPR argument. These assumptions enter the theory at clearly identifiable points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Realism\n",
    "Realism assumes that measurement outcomes correspond to pre-existing physical properties.  \n",
    "In the EPR framework, this is formalized by introducing hidden variables $( \\lambda )$ that determine the results of all possible measurements in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n",
    "$\n",
    "A = A(\\mathbf a,\\lambda), \\quad B = B(\\mathbf b,\\lambda),\n",
    "$\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ are the measurement outcomes $\\pm 1$ for Alice and Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the computational model, realism is encoded by deterministic response functions that assign outcomes based solely on $( \\lambda)$ and the local measurement setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Locality\n",
    "Locality requires that the outcome at one location cannot depend on the measurement choice made at a distant location.  \n",
    "This reflects the relativistic prohibition of faster-than-light causal influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally:\n",
    "$\n",
    "A(\\mathbf a,\\lambda) \\;\\text{is independent of}\\; \\mathbf b, \\quad\n",
    "B(\\mathbf b,\\lambda) \\;\\text{is independent of}\\; \\mathbf a.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption is built directly into Bell’s correlation formula:\n",
    "$\n",
    "E(\\mathbf a,\\mathbf b) = \\int d\\lambda \\, \\rho(\\lambda)\\, A(\\mathbf a,\\lambda)\\, B(\\mathbf b,\\lambda),\n",
    "$\n",
    "which factorizes the joint outcome into purely local contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bell’s Inequality as a Logical Consequence\n",
    "Using only:\n",
    "- the binary nature of outcomes $(A^2 = B^2 = 1)$,\n",
    "- locality,\n",
    "- realism,\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell derived inequalities that all local realistic theories must satisfy.  \n",
    "For the CHSH combination:\n",
    "$\n",
    "S = E(\\mathbf a,\\mathbf b)+E(\\mathbf a,\\mathbf b')+E(\\mathbf a',\\mathbf b)-E(\\mathbf a',\\mathbf b'),\n",
    "$\n",
    "local realism implies:\n",
    "$\n",
    "|S| \\le 2.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, this bound is **not** a quantum mechanical assumption; it is a purely classical constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How Quantum Mechanics Breaks the Structure\n",
    "Quantum mechanics violates Bell inequalities because it does **not** admit a representation of the form:\n",
    "$\n",
    "E(\\mathbf a,\\mathbf b) = \\int d\\lambda \\, \\rho(\\lambda)\\, A(\\mathbf a,\\lambda)\\, B(\\mathbf b,\\lambda).\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "For entangled states (such as the singlet), correlations are instead determined by the global quantum state:\n",
    "$\n",
    "E_{\\mathrm{QM}}(\\mathbf a,\\mathbf b) = -\\cos(\\theta_{ab}).\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual measurement outcomes remain random, but their correlations are constrained by entanglement in a way that cannot be decomposed into local predetermined values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conceptual Resolution\n",
    "Bell’s theorem therefore shows that the EPR assumptions of locality and realism cannot both be maintained if quantum mechanical predictions are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental and computational violations of Bell–CHSH inequalities imply that **any theory reproducing quantum correlations must abandon local realism**, though not necessarily relativistic causality or objective reality itself.\n"
